# Main instructions

1. Use the components in src/components/ui, reusable components go here.
2. Always try to use tailwind and only write css for cases that tailwind can't handle.
3. By default components/pages should be rendered client side. only render server side when it makes full sense.
4. All components should be covered by unit tests with Vitest.
5. During development I always have the dev server running.
